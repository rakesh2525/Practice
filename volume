volume is a storage device like harddrive in windows
                                           "General puropse SSD volumes (gp3 , gp2)"

Transactional workloads
Virtual desktops
Medium-sized, single-instance databases
Low-latency interactive applications
Development and test environments

                                          "Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes" (io2 ,io1)

Workloads that require sustained IOPS performance or more than 16,000 IOPS
I/O-intensive database workloads

                                          "HDD Volumes" (st1 , sc1)  - Big data
create volume:

volumetype - gp2,gp3,io2,i01,st1,sc1
Delete on termination- yes
Iops-3000  (  means which can handle 3000 requests per second like read ,write)
Throughput-125 (amount of data that can be transferred with speed)
size(gib)-8gb

lsblk - This command tells whether volume is available or attached
df -Th(type humanreadable) - show availables memory
volume should be in same region as same instance

Mount proceess: (we have to mount ebs to folder)
- lsblk
- df -Th
* we have to mount ebs to folder
- file -s /dev/xvdf       (xvdf is volume name it can be different)   shows output "data" which means os is not detecting
- mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf     (we are writing filesystem)
* Now we have to mount volume to folder
- mkdir ytvolume
- mount /dev/xvdf ytvolume/
- df -Th (It is mounted)
* This is temporary mount if system reboots it will go for this we have to write entry in last line it will be there we have copy it
- cat /etc/mtab (Entry will be there)
- vi /etc/fstab  (paste the entry)
- mount -all

* Now we have to increse volume from 8gb to 9gb
- lsblk
- df -Th(os detection for understanding)
- xfs_growfs -d /dev/xvdf  (dev/xvdf=mount path)

* For root volume  this is command = xfs_growfs -d / (if growfs not found install it)
